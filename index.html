    <h1><b>what is drawing?</b></h1> 
    <p>Drawing is a visual art that entails making a relationship on a surface, which is the expression of things mainly by line, spots, or any tool. It is a form of visual arts (plastic arts) and one of the seven arts.

      Drawing may be a recording of quick lines of some observations, scenes, or thoughts of a form at a particular moment, and it may be a preparatory work for another means of artistic expression, but it is often an independent, stand-alone work of art.
      
     <h2>Drawing principles</h2>
      
      The Viturian Man by Leonardo da Vinci, circa 1490.
      The most important principles of correct drawing is to start drawing the outer structure of the shape to be drawn, and pay attention to the distances between the shapes. If the drawing contains more than one shape, the closer the shape is, the larger its size and darker its color, and vice versa. Pay attention also to the factors of shadow and light, and also to how to mix colors properly.
      
      <h2>point and line:</h2>
      
      Drawing is basically a group of lines and points arranged in a certain way.
       Here we will pay more attention to the line, because the points do not need skill to draw them.
      
     <h2>types of drawing</h2>
      Drawings differ in their appearances, objectives, and types.
      
      In this scope, drawing can be divided into three types:
      
      Simple drawings (wheels): These are notes recorded of a specific thing or situation of importance at a particular moment.
      Preparatory fees: - They are preliminary fees for another means of preparation, such as photography and sculpture.
      Integrated drawings: - They are taken as a finished, independent, stand-alone artwork.</p>
